					description: `When something is referred to as mocha flavored, it's because it blends the flavors of chocolate and coffee. It's sweet like chocolate but with the roasty 
					qualities of a cup of coffee. Mocha powders will have the same consistency of cocoa powder, but if you add a touch liquid, they'll turn into thin pastes. If you've got a 
					natural mocha powder, it may even be a little silty. Mocha syrups can have a more viscous quality. This sweet beverage is a blend of espresso, steamed milk (cafes usually 
					have vegan milk options available) and chocolate powder or syrup. `,

					color: "#a2b168", 
					description: `Bubble tea tastes like a well balanced and sweet milky beverage with a slight twist, boba pearls. Though sweet, it's not overpoweringly sweet 
					since teas counteract sweetness and creaminess of boba flavors. Generally boba cafes will make a concentrate of tea and use this as the base of their milk teas. 
					Depending on what tea they use you'll taste robust black teas, light green teas or even lighter jasmine teas. Sometimes there's even herbal teas used in certain 
					types of drinks.`,

					description: `The caramel latte is another well-loved drink. And while some may confuse it with the caramel macchiato, it's much simpler to make. 
					This drink is sweetened with caramel syrup. Once the syrup is added, you simply need to add your shots, pour steamed milk and milk foam on top. 
					This helps create a pleasant coffee-caramel taste throughout the drink. Much like with the caramel macchiato, you can try countless variations on 
					this drink. Caramel is a flavor that agrees with dairy and non-dairy milk, although it goes especially well with the light, sweet flavor of coconut milk.`,

					description: `The first few sips (or, to be more accurate licks) of whipped cream at the top with pumpkin-spice sprinkles are heavenly. 
					It's hot and sweet with a very lightly spicy sweetness, a very pleasant but not overpowering fragrance and I could totally see myself buying 
					a bag of Starbucks pumpkin-spice flavored instant coffee (or DIYing it at home with the contents of my meagre spice cabinet). Pumpkin Spice Lattes are awesome!`,

					color: "#802e36", 
					description: `Cold brew has the potential to be some of the most even, flavorful, and delicious coffee that you can even question whether or not you're 
					even drinking coffee. A good cold brew shouldn't need cream or sugar as it should have an inherent sweetness (good quality beans brewed correctly can taste 
					sweet without additives) and it should be smooth enough to not need a cream or milk. However, if you want to add it, more power to you.`,

					all you have to do is scoop your coffee, pour it into the filter, pour some water in and press start to let the drip coffee maker 
					do its coffee magic. Soon, you'll hear the sweet sounds of your coffee dripping right into your coffee pot. Mornings, conquered.`,

					frappe is taken from frappé, a Greek iced coffee, or from the Boston area term for a thick milkshake frappe (pronounced "frap"), 
					both of which come from the French word frappé.The Frappuccino is a blended iced coffee drink that's topped with whipped cream and syrup. 
					But not all Frapps are made the same: watch out for coffee-free versions. Unless you're into that sorta thing.`,
